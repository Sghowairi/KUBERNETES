# A Daemon sets are used to ensure that all (or some) nodes in a cluster run a copy of a pod.
# The Perfect use case for a DaemonSet is running a cluster storage daemon on each node.
# # DaemonSets are also used for logging and monitoring agents, as well as for network proxies.
# # DaemonSets are also used for running system daemons, such as the kube-proxy and the kubelet.

# To create a DaemonSet, use the following command:
# kubectl create -f daemon-set.yaml
# or you can use the following Structure on the yaml file:
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: monitoring-daemon
  labels:
    env: production
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: monitoring-agent
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: monitoring-agent
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: monitoring-agent
          image: monitoring-agent:latest
          resources:
            requests:
              memory: "128Mi"
              cpu: 500m
            limits:
              memory: "256Mi"
              cpu: 1    

# # # This will ensure that the DaemonSet is scheduled on all nodes with the specified resources.

# To review the DaemonSet, use the following command:
# # # kubectl get daemonset <daemonset-name> -o yaml


# # To get the resource requests of a DaemonSet, use the following command:
# # kubectl get daemonset <daemonset-name> -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].resources.requests}'
