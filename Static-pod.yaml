# A Static Pod is a pod that is managed directly by the kubelet daemon on a specific node, rather than by the Kubernetes control plane.

# Static Pods are typically used for system-level components that need to run on a specific node, such as the kube-proxy or the kubelet itself.

# Static Pods are defined in a file on the node's filesystem, and the kubelet will automatically create and manage the pod based on that file.

# Static Pods are not managed by the Kubernetes API server, so they do not have the same lifecycle as regular pods.

# The File is typically located in the /etc/kubernetes/manifests directory on the node.

# The kubelet will watch this directory for changes and create or delete pods as necessary.

# To locate the file path open the kubelet configuration file:

# In /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml or kubelet.service >> look for the --pod-manifest-path flag or --config flag to open the kubelet configuration file and check staticPodPath 

## To control the static pod, you can use the Docker commands to start, stop, and remove the static pod.

## The Use Case for Static Pods is to run system-level components that need to run on a specific node, such as the kube-proxy or the kubelet itself.

## for creating a static pod ## 
### By default, the kubelet watches for static Pod manifests in:
# /etc/kubernetes/manifests/ 

# You can confirm or change this directory by checking the kubelet configuration:
# ps aux | grep kubelet

# Look for the --pod-manifest-path flag OR staticPodPath flag

### Create a static Pod manifest

# Create a YAML file in the manifest path. Example: /etc/kubernetes/manifests/nginx-pod.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-static
  labels:
    role: webserver
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80


#kubelet picks it up automatically
# Once the YAML file is placed in the directory, kubelet will detect it and create the Pod automatically â€” no need to run kubectl apply.
# crictl pods
