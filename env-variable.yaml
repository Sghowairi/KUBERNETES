        # The env field is a list of environment variables, where each environment variable is specified as a name-value pair.
        # The name of the environment variable is specified in the name field, and the value of the environment variable is specified in the value field.
        # The env field is optional, and if it is not specified, the container will not have any environment variables set when it is started.

        # The above environment variable will be set in the container when it is started, and its value will be production.
        # You can also use the valueFrom field to specify the value of the environment variable from a ConfigMap or Secret.

# There are Three ways to set environment variables in a Pod:
# 1. Using Plain Key-Value Pairs like: 
#    env:
#      - name: ENV_VAR_NAME
#        value: production

# 2. Using ConfigMaps like:
#    env:
#      - name: ENV_VAR_NAME 
#        valueFrom:
#          configMapKeyRef:
#            name: configmap-name
#            key: configmap-key

# 3. Using Secrets like:
#    env:
#      - name: ENV_VAR_NAME
#        valueFrom:
#          secretKeyRef:
#            name: secret-name
#            key: secret-key
