# Resource requests for a pod
# A resource request is a way to specify the minimum amount of resources that a pod needs in order to run. 
# It is a field of the pod spec that specifies the resources that a pod needs in order to run.
# To create a resource request on a pod, use the following command:
# ###### kubectl patch pod <pod-name> -p '{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"<container-name>","resources":{"requests":{"<resource-type>":"<value>"}}}]}}}'
# or you can use the following Structure on the yaml file:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-2
  labels:
    env: production
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx
      resources:
        requests:
          memory: "64Mi"
          cpu: 2
          #cpu: "250m"

# # This will ensure that the pod is scheduled on a node with the specified resources.

# 1 G (Gigabyte) = 1,000,000,000 bytes
# 1 M (Megabyte) = 1,000,000 bytes  
# 1 K (Kilobyte) = 1,000 bytes
# 1 Gi (Gibibyte) = 1,073,741,824 bytes
# 1 Mi (Mebibyte) = 1,048,576 bytes
# 1 Ki (Kibibyte) = 1,024 bytes
# 1 cpu = 1 core = 1 thread = 1 vCPU = 1 virtual CPU = 1 virtual core
# 1 m (millicore) = 0.001 core = 0.001 thread = 0.001 vCPU = 0.001 virtual CPU = 0.001 virtual core


# # To get the resource requests of a pod, use the following command:
# # kubectl get pods <pod-name> -o jsonpath='{.spec.containers[0].resources.requests}'
# # ###### kubectl get pods nginx-2 -o jsonpath='{.spec.containers[0].resources.requests}'

# # To get the resource requests of a replicaset, use the following command:
# # kubectl get replicaset <replicaset-name> -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].resources.requests}'


# To Resource limits for a pod
# A resource limit is a way to specify the maximum amount of resources that a pod can use.
# It is a field of the pod spec that specifies the resources that a pod can use in order to run.
# To create a resource limit on a pod, use the following command:
# ###### kubectl patch pod <pod-name> -p '{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"<container-name>","resources":{"limits":{"<resource-type>":"<value>"}}}]}}}'
# or you can use the following Structure on the yaml file:

# apiVersion: v1
# kind: Pod
# metadata:
#   name: nginx-2
#   labels:
#     env: production
# spec:
#   containers:
#     - name: nginx
#       image: nginx
#       resources:
#         limits:
#           memory: "128Mi"
#           cpu: 4
#          #cpu: "500m"

# # This will ensure that the pod is scheduled on a node with the specified resources.  

## The Container Cpu can't exceed its limitations 
## The Container Memory exceed its limit and the container will fail with OOM (Out of Memory) error.
