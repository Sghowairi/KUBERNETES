# a node selector is a label query over a set of resources, such as nodes or pods. It allows you to select a subset of resources based on their labels.
# a node selector is a simple way to constrain pods to nodes with specific labels. It is a field of the pod spec that specifies the labels that a pod must match in order to be scheduled on a node.
# To create a node selector on a pod, use the following command:
# ###### kubectl patch pod <pod-name> -p '{"spec":{"nodeSelector":{"<key>":"<value>"}}}'
# or you can use the following Structure on the yaml file:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-2
  labels: 
    env: production
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx
  nodeSelector:
    size: large

# This will ensure that the pod is scheduled on a node with the label size=large.
# But also other pods can be scheduled on the same node. 

# To label a node, use the following command:
## kubectl label nodes <node-name> <key>=<value>
# ###### kubectl label nodes node01 size=large
