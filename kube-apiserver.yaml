# Kube-api server:-
# Authentication: verifies the identity of the user or service account that is making the request.

# Retrieve Data: retrieves the data from the etcd store that is needed to process the request.
# Update etcd: updates the etcd store with the new state of the cluster.
# Scheduler and Controller Manager: the kube-apiserver interacts with the scheduler and controller manager to schedule pods and manage the lifecycle of the cluster.
