# In a Pod definition file we could specify the arguments to be passed to the container when it is started.
# # The arguments are specified in the args field of the container spec.
# # The args field is a list of strings, where each string is an argument to be passed to the container.
# # The args field is optional, and if it is not specified, the container will use the default command and arguments specified in the image.

# pod definition file using the args field:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    env: production
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx
      command:
        - /bin/bash
        - -c
        - echo "Hello World"
    # command: ["/bin/bash", "-c", "echo Hello World"]
    # The command field is used to specify the command to be run when the container is started.
    # The command field is like the ENTRYPOINT field in the Dockerfile.
      args:
        - /bin/bash
        - -c
        - echo "Hello World"
    # args:["/bin/bash", "-c", "echo Hello World"]
        # The above command will print "Hello World" to the console when the container is started.
        # The args field can also be used to pass arguments to a script or command that is specified in the CMD field in Dockerfile.
  

# If you want to run a command in the container and pass arguments to it, you can use the --command -- <cmd> <args1> <args2> syntax
# or you can use the -- <args1> <args2> syntax to pass arguments to the command that is specified in the image.
### kubectl run nginx --image=nginx -- "Hello World"

# The -- indicates the end of the options for the kubectl command and the beginning of the command to be run in the container.

# For example, to run the echo command in the nginx container and pass "Hello World" as an argument, you can use the following command:
### kubectl exec -it nginx -- echo "Hello World"
# This will run the echo command in the nginx container and print "Hello World" to the console.

# or create a new pod with the same name and run the echo command in it.
### kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --command -- echo "Hello World"
# The --command flag is used to specify that the command should be run in the container, and the -- indicates the end of the options for the kubectl command and the beginning of the command to be run in the container.
# This will create a new pod with the name nginx and run the echo command in it, printing "Hello World" to the console.
