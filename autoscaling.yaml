# Autoscaling are used to automatically adjust the number of replicas of a service based on the load.
# The autoscaling can be done using the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) and the Cluster Autoscaler.
# The HPA --- automatically scales the number of replicas of a service based on the CPU utilization or other metrics.
# The VPA | automatically adjusts the resource requests and limits of a pod based on the resource utilization of the pod.
# The Cluster Autoscaler [] automatically scales the number of nodes in a cluster based on the resource utilization of the nodes.

# The HPA and Cluster Autoscaler can be used together to automatically scale the number of replicas of a service and the number of nodes in a cluster.

# The HPA --- can be created using the following command:
# kubectl autoscale deployment <deployment-name> --cpu-percent=<cpu-percentage> --min=<min-replicas> --max=<max-replicas>
# The HPA can also be created using the following structure in the yaml file:
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: nginx-hpa
  namespace: default

  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1

# To check the HPA, use the following command:
# #### kubectl get hpa
# # The HPA --- will automatically scale the number of replicas of the nginx-deployment based on the CPU utilization.
# # The minReplicas and maxReplicas fields specify the minimum and maximum number of replicas, respectively.
# # The metrics field specifies the metrics to be used for scaling.
# # The type field specifies the type of metric to be used for scaling.
# # The resource field specifies the resource to be used for scaling.
# # The target field specifies the target value for the metric.
# # The averageUtilization field specifies the target average CPU utilization for the replicas.



# The VPA | automatically adjusts the resource requests and limits of a pod based on the resource utilization of the pod.
# The VPA can be created using the following command:
# kubectl apply -f vpa.yaml
# The VPA can also be created using the following structure in the yaml file:
#apiVersion: autoscaling.k8s.io/v1
