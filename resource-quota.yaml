# to limit resources in namespaces:
# create a Resource Quota file:
 apiVersion: v1
 kind: ResourceQuota 
 metadata:
   name: dev-quota
   namespace: dev
 spec: 
   hard:
     pods: "10"
     requests.cpu: "4"
     requests.memory: 5Gi
     limits.cpu: "10"
     limits.memory: 10Gi

# kubectl create -f ResourceQuota.yaml
# kubectl describe resourcequota dev-quota --namespace=dev
#
# The pods field is the number of pods that can be created in the namespace.
# The requests.cpu field is the total amount of CPU that can be requested by all pods in the namespace.
# The requests.memory field is the total amount of memory that can be requested by all pods in the namespace.
# The limits.cpu field is the total amount of CPU that can be limited by all pods in the namespace.
# The limits.memory field is the total amount of memory that can be limited by all pods in the namespace.
#
# # To get the resource quota of a namespace, use the following command:
# # kubectl get resourcequota <resource-quota-name> --namespace=<namespace-name> -o jsonpath='{.spec.hard}'
# # ###### kubectl get resourcequota dev-quota --namespace=dev -o jsonpath='{.spec.hard}'
