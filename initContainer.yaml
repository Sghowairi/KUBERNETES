# The initContainer is a special type of container that runs before the main container in a pod.
# It is used to perform initialization tasks that need to be completed before the main container starts.
# Init containers are defined in the pod specification and are run in the order they are defined.
# Each init container must complete successfully before the next one starts.
# If an init container fails, the pod will not start and the init container will be restarted until it succeeds.
# Init containers are useful for tasks such as setting up the environment, waiting for a service to be available, or performing database migrations.
## To create an init container, you can use the following command:
# ###### kubectl run <pod-name> --image=<image-name> --init-container -- <command>
# or you can use the following Structure on the yaml file:
#
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    env: production
spec:
  initContainers:
    - name: init-myservice
      image: busybox
      command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo "Hello from init container"']
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
      command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo "Hello from main container"']

# # The init container will run first and print "Hello from init container" to the console.
# # After the init container completes successfully, the main container will start and print "Hello from main container" to the console.

# The initContainer can be multiple and they will run in the order they are defined.

# You can use the following yaml structure to create a pod with a multi init container: 
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    env: production
spec:
  initContainers:
    - name: init-myservice
      image: busybox
      command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo "Hello from init container 1"']
    - name: init-myservice-2
      image: busybox
      command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo "Hello from init container 2"']
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
      command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo "Hello from main container"']

# To check the logs of the init container, you can use the following command:
# ###### kubectl logs <pod-name> -c <init-container-name>
# ###### kubectl logs nginx -c init-myservice
# or you can use the following command to check the logs of all containers in the pod:
# ###### kubectl logs <pod-name> --all-containers=true
